"Missing Women in Research" (with Yann Bramoullé, Roberta Ziparo)
 <p align="justify">
<sub> Matching the universe of PhD graduations in France across all academic disciplines between 1988 and 2021 and Scopus bibliometric data, we estimate the number of missing women in academia. To do so, we estimate the gender gap in publications both on the extensive - the probability of publishing - and the intensive margin - the number of missing publications. We explore how the number of missing women varies across time and disciplines. We also show how it correlates with initial gaps in PhD participation and the student-supervisor match characteristics. Preliminary findings show that female PhD students are less likely to have at least one publication, and if they do, they are less likely to  publish in their career. We observe however heterogeneous trends across disciplines.</sub>

"Missing Women in Research" (with Yann Bramoull√©, Roberta Ziparo)
 <p align="justify">
<sub> Matching the universe of PhD graduations in France across all disciplines between 1988 and 2021 and Scopus bibliometric data, we estimate the number of missing women in academia both on the extensive - the probability of publishing - and the intensive margin - the number of missing publications. 
We explore how the number of missing women varies across time and disciplines. We also show how it correlates with initial gaps in PhD participation and the student-supervisor match characteristics. Preliminary findings show that female PhD students will be less likely to have at least one publication, and if they do, they will publish less in their careers. We observe heterogeneous trends across disciplines. </sub>

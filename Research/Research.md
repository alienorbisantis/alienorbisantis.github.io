"Missing Women in Research" (with Yann Bramoullé and Roberta Ziparo)
 <p align="justify">
<sub> We provide the first comprehensive analysis of gender gaps in academic trajectories post-graduation for an entire country, across all academic disciplines, and over more than 30 years. To do this, we combine data on the universe of PhD graduations in France between 1988 and 2021 with data on academic publications. We document the presence of persistent negative gender gaps. Strikingly, these gaps are, if anything, worse in disciplines where women are well represented among PhD graduates. Overall, women with a PhD are less likely than men to ever publish in Humanities and Law, STEM, and Social Sciences. Publishing women publish less publications than publishing men in all fields, and these publications have lower impact in Biological and Earth Sciences and Social Sciences. We detect positive gender gaps in two cases. Women are more likely than men to ever publish in Biological and Earth Sciences and publications of publishing women have a higher impact in STEM. While most disciplines outside of STEM have reached or exceeded gender parity among PhD graduates, our results suggest the existence of significant barriers affecting women in the transition from a PhD to an academic career. We estimate that removing these barriers would lead 15% of non-publishing female PhD graduates to become academically active, representing a significant number of missing women in research. </sub>

"Gender Disparities in French Academic Carreers: A Multi-Stage Analysis of Selection"

<p align="justify">
<sub> This project examines the French academic pipeline to identify when and why women become underrepresented in faculty positions: I investigate whether they are less likely to apply, less likely to succeed or a combination of both. Using comprehensive administrative data combining Thèses.fr doctoral records and administrative data from the Conseil National des Universités (CNU), I analyze gender gaps at each critical transition: from PhD completion through qualification to securing permanent positions. I then exploit the exogenous variation in the number of job openings per year to examine whether tighter competition boosts or blocks women's access to permanent positions. My preliminary findings reveal significant discipline-specific patterns: in biological sciences, female PhD graduates are 3.5% less likely than males to apply for qualification, 8% less likely to pursue permanent positions when qualified, and 20% less likely to secure these positions when applying. In STEM fields, female PhD graduates are 6% less likely than males to apply for qualification, 4% less likely to apply for permanent positions when qualified, and 6% less likely to secure these positions when applying. Social sciences exhibit a reverse trend, with women 6% more likely than men to apply for qualification, with no significant gender differences in subsequent stages. In humanities, I found no significant gender differences across any stage.

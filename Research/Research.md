"Missing Women in Research" (with Yann Bramoullé, Roberta Ziparo)
 <p align="justify">
<sub> Matching the universe of PhD graduations in France across all disciplines between 1988 and 2021 and Scopus bibliometric data, we estimate the number of missing women in academia both on the extensive - the probability of publishing - and the intensive margin - the number of missing publications. 
We explore how the number of missing women varies across time and disciplines. We also show how it correlates with initial gaps in PhD participation and the student-supervisor match characteristics. Preliminary findings show that female PhD students will be less likely to have at least one publication, and if they do, they will publish less in their careers. We observe heterogeneous trends across disciplines. </sub>

"Gender Gap in Chess and Online Competitions"" (with Sam Jackson, Emma Paladino)
 <p align="justify">
<sub> Despite women representing 10% of chess players around the world, the one-hundred highest rated players in world-rankings are men. Empirical evidence has demonstrated the existence of a small but significant disadvantage faced by women when facing male counterparts in official competition, which is not explained by age, experience or objective skill level. Existing works have conjectured as explanatory factors some elements of the environment in which official chess competitions are held. Indeed, chess is a male centric sports and its culture is strill strongly male dominated. Moreover, players often compete in full view of other competitors and spectators. These cultural and environmental conditions might contribute to a psychologically discouraging effect for female competitors. This paper aims to examine this mechanism. Using data from FIDE sanctioned tournaments from 2020 onwards, we determine whether the disadvantage faced by women remains even once that the majority of tournaments are played online. The analysis focuses on the outcome of the matches, as well as on the accuracy of the players.

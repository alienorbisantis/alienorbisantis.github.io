I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in economics at Aix-Marseille School of Economics (AMSE) under the supervision of [Yann Bramoullé](https://sites.google.com/site/bramoulley/)  and [Roberta Ziparo](https://sites.google.com/site/rziparo/).

In my research, I document gender gaps across academic disciplines and examine how competition in male-dominated environments affects women's performance and career trajectories.

I was visiting Boston University in Spring 2025, invited by Professor [Patricia Cortés](https://sites.google.com/site/pcortesbu/).

I will be visiting DIW Berlin in June 2025, invited by Professor [Katharina Wrohlich](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=dJY35cYAAAAJ&hl=de).
